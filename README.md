The app is built using Jetpack Compose for a fully declarative UI, Navigation Component for seamless screen transitions,
Dagger-Hilt for dependency injection, MVVM architecture for clean separation of concerns, and Retrofit for network communication with a RESTful news API.

Jetpack Compose: For building responsive and dynamic UI components.
Navigation Component: To manage in-app navigation between screens like Home, Details, and Settings.
Dagger-Hilt: For dependency injection to manage ViewModels, repositories, and network clients.
MVVM Architecture: To separate UI logic from business logic and data handling.
Retrofit: To fetch  data from a public API (e.g., https://api.jsonbin.io).
